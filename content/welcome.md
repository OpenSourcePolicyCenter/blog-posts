Summary: The Open Source Policy Center is making policy analysis more transparent, accessible, and innovative by harnessing open source methods to build cutting edge economic models and a webapp for accessing those models.  

Welcome to OSPC.org.  

The Open Source Policy Center offers a collaborative and technology-driven fix for a policy evaluation process that inhibits democratic participation in government and constrains the creativity of economic policymakers. The OSPC community is working to make policy analysis more transparent, accessible, and innovative by harnessing open-source methods and a growing community of expert contributors to build cutting edge economic models. 

Policymakers and the public depend on economic models to determine how a policy may affect the government's budget, whom a policy will help or hurt, and how a policy might change people's behavior and affect the economy as a whole. As a result, economic models -- ranging from microsimulation models of individual behavior, to time-series forecasting models, to fully articulated simulations of the macroeconomy -- powerfully influence which policy ideas become law. 

Historically, most modeling institutions have lacked the mandate from elected officials to take advantage of technological developments that would allow for greater transparency and widespread collaboration on these models. Therefore, despite their influence, most policy-relevant economic models exist as proprietary simulation software that is only available to a select few. Even most policymakers (including members of congress and leading presidential candidates) don’t have access to this software, making it very difficult for them to generate creative policy solutions or even to participate in policy debates. What’s more, limited availability and transparency undermines external review and stifles innovation. 

This status quo inhibits democratic participation in government and constrains effective economic policymaking. 

The motivating principle behind the Open Source Policy Center is that policymakers and the public should have the best tools for understanding policy and that those tools should be completely transparent and collaborative in order to guarantee innovation and quality. 

With that in mind, OSPC brings together an open-source community of economists, software engineers, and policy analysts who collaboratively produce open-source computational economic models and web applications that allow non-programmers to easily interact with those models.

The community's first priority is building simulation models of the federal individual income tax system, similar in capability to those used by the official analytical arms of Congress and the Executive Branch, the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Office of Tax Analysis at the Treasury Department. Later projects  move beyond taxes to model other areas of economic policy, including spending programs. 

OSPC projects that have reached the alpha or beta stage include Taxcalc, the first-ever open-source microsimulation model of the US individual income tax code, and USOG, the first-ever open-source large-scale dynamic overlapping generations model of the US economy. To enable policymakers, journalists, students, and citizens to interact with the models and gauge first-hand the effects of policies, the OSPC community has also developed an easy-to-use web application called TaxBrain. 

OSPC is not just product oriented, it is also process oriented. In other words, the intent is not just to build models, but to develop a technological approach and workflow that enables geographically-dispersed experts to work collaboratively on models in an open and transparent environment. By doing so, we hope to help pave the way for others to adopt a more collaborative, transparent, and accessibility-driven approach to the development of policy-relevant economic models.

OSPC is designed to serve as a laboratory for transparent, accessible, and collaborative public policy analysis. The target audience is people who care deeply about policy and have the skills, energy, and passion to make it better. The OSPC community's projects enable individuals from all backgrounds to come together to improve policy by making better tools for policy analysis.
