Summary: The Open Source Policy Center is making policy analysis more trustworthy, accessible, and innovative by harnessing open-source methods to build cutting edge economic models.  

Welcome to OSPC.org.  

The Open Source Policy Center is a subversive response to a fundamental challenge to public policy in the 21st century: a policy evaluation process that undermines democratic participation in government and fails to encourage better economic policy. Our community is making policy analysis more trustworthy, accessible, and innovative by harnessing open-source methods to build cutting edge economic models. 

Policymakers and the public (whether they know it or not) are absolutely dependent on computational economic models. Those models dictate how we think a policy will affect the government’s budget, whom we think a policy will hurt or help, and how we think a policy will change people’s behavior and affect the economy as a whole. At the end of the day, models massively influence which policy ideas become law. 

What even fewer people realize is that these fundamentally important “economic models” exist as proprietary simulation software—black boxes, really—closely held and controlled by a few organizations. Even most policymakers (including members of congress and presidential candidates) don’t have access to this software, which means it is very difficult for them to generate creative policy solutions or even participate in policy debates. What’s more, this lack of transparency and access means that there is limited peer review, little journalistic scrutiny, and unsurprisingly, few major innovations. [KEEP THIS LAST SENTENCE?]

The status quo undermines democratic participation in government and prevents policymakers from producing creative and effective policy proposals. As a result, our democracy and economy suffer.

The Open Source Policy Center’s founding beliefs are that policymakers and their boss, the public, should have the best tools for understanding policy and that those tools should be 100% transparent and collaborative to guarantee innovation and quality. 

We have acted on those beliefs by jumpstarting an open-source community of economists, software engineers, and policy analysts who collaboratively produce economic models that are available to everyone.

The Open Source Policy Center's primary mission is to fundamentally improve computational modeling for policy analysis by making the modeling process more transparent, collaborative, and accessible by developing open-source models and apps for interacting with those models. 

Our first priority is building simulation models of the federal individual income tax system, similar to those used by the official analytical arms of Congress and the Executive Branch, the Joint Committee on Taxation, Congressional Budget Office, and the Office of Tax Analysis at the Treasury Department. We plan to move beyond taxes in the future. 

OSPC projects that have reached the alpha or beta stage include Taxcalc, the first-even open source microsimulation model of the individual income tax code, and US-OG, the first-eve open source large-scale dynamic overlapping generations model of the US economy. We have also developed TaxBrain, an easy-to-use online interfaces that allows students, policymakers, journalists, and citizens to interact with the models and learn for themselves about the effects of policies.

OSPC is designed to serve as a much-needed laboratory for transparent, accessible, and collaborative public policy analysis. We know that there is a mass of people who care deeply about policy and have the skills, energy, and passion to make it better. Our projects enable individuals from economics, scientific, engineering, and policy backgrounds to come together to improve policy by making better tools for policy analysis.
